# luau-polyfill
A set of utilities to mimic common JS polyfills needed for translating projects from JS to Lua/Luau

## Note
Due to [this issue](https://github.com/seaofvoices/darklua/issues/266) with darklua, the pesde package was not uploaded to the roblox target. Use [jsdotlua's one instead](https://github.com/jsdotlua/luau-polyfill) for Roblox.
